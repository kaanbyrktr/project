## Theoretical description and explanation
The Smart Plant Watering System with Data Logging Feature is designed to provide an intelligent and automated solution for plant care. Using soil moisture sensors, humidity sensors, temperature sensors, a relay, and a Microcontroller Unit (MCU), the system aims to optimize the watering process based on real-time environmental conditions. Additionally, the project incorporates data logging capabilities for users to track and analyze the plant's environment over time, ensuring optimal growth conditions.

## Hardware description of demo application

### Soil Moisture Sensor:
Utilized to measure the moisture content in the soil.

### Temperature and Humidity Sensor:
Monitors the temperature of the soil and the humidity levels in the surrounding air.
Ensures that the plant is in an environment with an appropriate temperature and humidity range.

### Relay:
Controls the water supply based on the sensor readings.
Emulates activation or deactivation of the water pump or irrigation system.

### OLED Display
Real-time feedback on soil moisture, humidity and temperature displayed on the OLED.

### Microcontroller Unit (MCU):
Acts as the brain of the system, processing sensor data and making decisions.
